p We are a group in the Charlotte area looking to make a difference in the lives of animals in the food, entertainment, research, and clothing industries. If you support the ethical treatment of animals join us as we educate ourselves and others through activities such as lobbying, gentle protesting, letter writing events, leafleting, and meeting victims of animal cruelty by visiting sanctuaries. Join us as we raise awareness and speak out on behalf of those who canâ€™t.
